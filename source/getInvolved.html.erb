                    GiveCamp is an immense project that needs support from companies and people like you to bring it together, and offers a 
                    unique opportunity: where sponsorship for other technical conferences is about getting in front of conference attendees, 
                    GiveCamp is an opportunity to get behind the developers and professionals in attendance, and helping them give back to the 
                    community. Your sponsorship helps provide the food, drink, and facilities to fuel our events, allowing GiveCamp volunteers 
                    to focus on their talent contributions.
