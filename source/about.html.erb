          <p>GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where software developers, designers, and database administrators donate
            their time to create custom software for non-profit organizations. This custom software could be a new
            website for the nonprofit organization, a small data-collection application to keep track of members, or a
            application for the Red Cross that automatically emails a blood donor three months after they’ve donated
            blood to remind them that they are now eligible to donate again. The only limitation is that the project
            should be scoped to be able to be completed in a weekend.</p>
          <p>During GiveCamp, developers are welcome to go home in the evenings or camp out all weekend long. There are
            usually food and drink provided at the event. There are sometimes even game systems set up for when you and
            your need a little break!&nbsp; Overall, it’s a great opportunity for people to work together, developing
            new friendships, and doing something important for their community.</p>
          <p>At GiveCamp, there is an expectation of “What Happens at GiveCamp, Stays at GiveCamp”. Therefore, all
            source code must be turned over to the charities at the end of the weekend (developers cannot ask for
            payment) and the charities are responsible for maintaining the code moving forward (charities cannot expect
            the developers to maintain the codebase).</p>
          <p>For more information about GiveCamp, feel free to explore this site. We’ve posted links to the web sites
            of all our&nbsp;GiveCamp communities – perhaps there is one near you!<span>&nbsp; </span>If not, feel free
            to read over the <%= link_to 'GiveCamp Cookbook', '/cookbook' %>. This is a wiki that captures the best practices
            and varied experiences of past GiveCamp events to make it easy for you to jump start a GiveCamp event in
            your area.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, please let me know and I’ll do everything in my power to help make sure that
            your GiveCamp experience is a memorable one!</p>
