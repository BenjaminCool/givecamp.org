## The Main Event!

Organizing and running a successful GiveCamp event involves keeping up with a lot of different
aspects of
event management:

1. Volunteers
1. Venue
1. Sponsors
1. Charities
1. Prizes & Giveaways
1. Ceremony
1. Timeline

GiveCamp is a fun and exciting event to be part of but does not come for free. As with any
large-scale event,
running a successful GiveCamp requires a lot of coordination work to bring all the pieces together.
Ideally,
the leadership team for an event like this would consist of 3 main players:

* **Leader:** someone, or perhaps a few someones, to serve as spokespersons for the
  event. They would take on the
  accountability for making sure that the event actually happens, recruit other leaders, approve
  spending, etc.
  Basically ?this person is the central point of contact for the event.

* **Participant Coordinator:** this person would be responsible for recruiting
  developers, designers, dba? and
  other participants for the event. They would be responsible for putting together the
  communications for this group and work
  to assign them to charities once collected. An important aspect of this position is making sure
  that you have enough, b
  candidates on each team to prevent problems arising from lack of technical skill.

* **Charity Coordinator:** this person is responsible for identifying and qualifying
  charities and other non-profits
  for participation in the event. The big ?otcha?here is making sure that the development teams
  will have enough information to
  build something for the charity. The developers should get some 1:1 time with the charity reps
  at the beginning of the event,
  but the more pre-qualification can be done before the event the better.

There is no way that one or two people could pull off an event like this of any scale without
getting help. There are several
other roles (not necessarily separate people) that are critical to the success of the event, and
are listed here:

* **Analyst:** part of the charity pre-qualification involves learning about the
  charities that have applied and
  determining if the charity is a good fit for the event. Typical analyst duties include:

  * calling the charity to determine initial requirements and scope
  * writing up a summary of the charity? requirements for public consumption and team
assignments
  * Serving as point of contact for that charity in communicating dates, times, and other
charity responsibilities

* **Venue Coordinator:** someone on the team will need to make sure that a venue has
  been selected that is
  large enough to support the size of the event, and provides adequate space for the different
  teams to work. See Venue
  section below for more information.

## Venue

Our first event was done at a Microsoft Partner facility that had multiple cubicles and office
spaces for each
of the teams to work semi-privately. An alternative might be to get one big giant room, like a
gymnasium, and
have tables for people to work at. It would probably be noisy this way, but would probably feel
more like a
larger group effort ?like HackFest does when everyone is in the same room. For the first event, our
venue
coordinator worked with a couple of sponsors to help pay for meals and made sure that they were
ordered,
delivered and set up on time. Having snacks around and a couple of Xbox 360s also helped people
take the
occasional breaks as well.

There are a couple of important things to consider when selecting a venue, including:

* **Building Access:** is it open 24 hours? What’s the process for getting entry
  after hours? In
  Dallas, we bought a pay-by-the-minute cell phone that could be used across GiveCamp events so
  that people
  could call when they were outside for us to come open the door and activate the elevator. That
  worked out
  really well as there was only one phone number to rememeber (we put that number on the backs of
  their ID
  badges) and we could trade off duties by handing the phone to each other during the event. Also
  think about
  air conditioning and heat, depending on the time of year…
* **Network:** the big challenge here is bandwidth and network availability. Is the
  network
  locked by a WEP key? We put the SSID and Key information on their ID badges too, just like the
  phone
  number, so it was easy for people to access in case they needed it.
 * **Refrigeration:** lots of caffene means lots of drinks means lots of room for
  them. Ice
  chests are good, but refrigerators are better. Ice machines with warm soda is a good backup,
  but I’m not a
  big fan because of the extra cups needed and extra mess generated. Plus, if you run out of ice,
  for cold
  drinks, developers get cranky…

## Sponsors

Sponsorship is another important key to running a successful event. Unless you have a personal
benefactor, or
are independently wealthy, you’ll probably want to try to recruit some local area sponsors to help
pay for
things. Good items for sponsorship include:

* Venue
* T-Shirts
* Laptop Stickers
* Goodie-bag items for Developers
* Goodie-bag items for Charities
* Meals and Snacks
* ID Badges and Printer Ink
* Drinks (one of our sponsors bought us an Iced Tea maker!)
* Trophies and recognition awards such as certificates, medals, buttons, etc.

Rather than take money, it’s always easier to take goods – so unless you’re willing to incur the tax
implications of receiving money from a company, or set up a Non-Profit of your own to handle it, I
suggest
getting good as donations. For example – see if Dunkin’ Donuts would be willing to sponsor
Breakfast one
morning, or In-n-Out Burger sponsor dinner…

## Charities

The whole point of GiveCamp is to make a difference in your local community. That means finding the
right
charities, getting them signed up and making sure that the teams building applications for them are
focused on
providing high value in a short timeframe.

Recruiting widely and early will help everyone get the most out of the event. For the 35 charities
that
responded to our original request, we ended up with 18 going into the competition. The decision to
pair them
down this far was based on the number of developers we had participating, the size of the venue we
would be
working in, and the requests of the charities themselves. It was important to us to make sure that
the
participating charities were actually non-profits and/or charities, and that they had well defined
requirements
that our teams had a good chance of completing by the end of the weekend.

Based on what we learned from the first of these events, all participating charities should be
encouraged to
attend as much of the event as possible. Having representatives from the charities on site made a
BIG
difference not only in the quality of the development products produced, but helped raise the
morale of the
development teams to have someone with whom they could work closely on their development. The
happiest of
development teams came from those that got to spend a large amount of time with their charities.

## Prizes &amp; Giveaways

For each of the charities, we offered up a ?asket of goodies?containing books and software. This is
a *great*
place to get Microsoft involved as a sponsor ?sponsoring these baskets. Here? what was in our
original basket
from January, 2008:

* Visual Studio 2005 (2008 had not yet been released)
* Expression Suite 1.0
* Vista Ultimate
* Office 2007 Ultimate
* Programming SQL Server 2005
* Expression Web Step by Step
* Expression Design Step by Step

Note that over time, we’ve learned that most charities aren’t going to make as much use of the
software, so
we’re probably going to stop donating that to each charity and perhaps raffle off some of them as
prizes to
developers that attend. It’s the developers that would make best use of them anyway.

## Ceremony and Parties

We also suggest both a pre-event kick-off meeting, and a post-event demo+awards meeting. The
pre-event kickoff
meeting is intended to accomplish several goals:

* Get everyone together, face to face, so that we can all meet
* Give the developers a chance to meet charity representatives in a 1:1 environment
* Give the developers a chance to meet their development teams
* Describe the rules of the competition, if there is to be a competition
* Give all sponsors a chance to speak in front of the participants
* Give the charities their goodie bags
* Give the developers their goodie bags

The post-event meeting accomplished the following goals:

* Give each development team the opportunity to demonstrate their solutions to the entire audience
* Award prizes
* Food, Fun and Fellowship after the event
* Put a ?ow?on the event

## Technology Considerations
At the end of the day, these events are about providing technology solutions to non-profits and
charities. We
have several partners that we’ve been working with that provide some valuable services and software
packages
for our use. To compliment that list, here is a list of technology considerations we’ve put
together in support
of running a b and developer-friendly event:

* **Networking:** Whether it’s wireless or wired connections, you’ve got to make
 sure that a
 solid and reliable fast connection. Especially considering the nature of the hosted web sites
 and
 databases… I’d also consider stress testing your environment if you’re not sure. Even at
 off-peak times,
 100 developers hitting the web at the same time might overwhelm your network.

* **Source control:** Our friends at [SaaS Made Easy](http://saasmdeeasy.com)
 have
 agreed to host TFS sites for each of the charities participating in GiveCamp. You can always go
 with
 another SCC, but why would you want to?

* **Web hosting:** we’ve been lucky to get the support of [DiscountASP.NET](http://www.discountasp.net)
 for all our web hosting needs. You can certainly reach out to them as one of our partners, or
 (as some have
 done) set up your own hosting. If you’re going to self host, think about the variety of
 applications you’ll
 be supporting such as Web servers and Database servers, or whatever else your application
 needs.

* **CMS installs:** we’ve also got some great partnerships with software providers
 to provide
 free licenses of their software, but it doesn’t hurt to download those installers early to have
 around. You
 can use the Microsoft Web Platform Installer for some of these, or you can download the
 installers yourself
 and provide to the teams:
  * Graffiti (Telligent)
  * Sitefinity (Telerik)
  * DotNet Nuke
  * WordPress
  * Joomla
  * mojoPortal
  * Drupal

* Power strips and extension cords – always important
* Printers – sometimes you need to print stuff
* Printer paper + extra ink
* Whiteboards
* Paper pads, pens &amp; pencils
* Web cams – these are useful if you want to provide Live Streaming

This list is just a start, as each venue is different, but thinking about thge technology you’ll
need beforehand
can save a lot of trouble.

An important technical aspect of working with the charities is remembering that they are not
technical wizards.
When building a system for them to use the developers need to keep in mind that semi- to
non-technical people
will do most of the site maintenance. Using the products of one of our CMS partners is very highly
encouraged.
The event is not about showing off your mad technical skillz – it’s about providing value to the
charities.
Setting up and customizing one of the popular CMS packages, updaing the theme, outlining the
content, adding
downloadable plugins, and even developing your own plugin is the best use of your time while at the
event.

Then, once the application is developed, make sure it gets deployed before you go home. 90% of the
time, it is
up to the development team at GiveCamp to coordinate with the hosting provider, configure the
domain name, and
deploy the application to the web. Your charity will NOT KNOW HOW to do this, so you need to make
sure you do
it for them. Since you’re using a CMS package, the charity should be able to maintain the site
after you turn
it over, but if it’s not deployed, they won’t be able to update it.

## The Code – Who Owns It?

The main idea here is to build applications for charities as they usually don’t have the capacity to
build their
own sites, and we have the knowledge to get them up and running quickly. Once the code is written,
it should
get turned over to the charity.Â&nbsp; GiveCamp.org will hold absolutely no claims to the code that
is written
at one of our events, and each event organizer needs to make sure that all of the teams, and the
charities know
that.Â&nbsp; Some groups have recommended that each of the projects be published as Open Source,
and allow
anyone to work on and/or contribute to the code.Â&nbsp; As far as GiveCamp.org is concerned this is
perfectly
acceptable, as long as the charity (for whom we’re doing the work) is OK with that. Many of the
charities I
have talked to tell a story about how they lost control of their web site source code, and were no
longer able
to maintain it. As long as the charity understands what Open Source means, and they’re OK with it,
I think it’s
fine to proceed that way. Otherwise, the charity should own all rights to the source code that is
created for
them.

## Other Notes

* The suggestion was made at #WAM2010 to post a contact number on the public event web site so
  that family
  members can reach the event staff if they’re not sure where their loved ones are. With so many
  people
  working so late into the night, it is useful for them to have someone to call and ask “when did
  my husband
  leave the event tonight?” without wondering if they ran into any problems on the road and are
  unable to
  call home.

* Consider creating some type of document that both the charity/non-profit and the developers
  sign that
  basically says “what happens at GiveCamp stays at GiveCamp”. This document would protect the
  charity from
  developers that don’t turn over source code or try to charge the charity, and protect the
  develpers from
  being forced to maintain the code they developed at the event.

* When organizing your event be sure to contact any [PMI](http://www.pmi.org/)
  (Project Management
  Institute), [IIBA](http://www.theiiba.org/) (The International institute of Business
  Analysis, [ISSA](http://www.issa.org/") (Information Systems Security Association), [AITP](http://www.aitp.org/)
  (Association of Information Technology Professionals) chapters or any other user groups in your
  area they
  can be invaluable resources.
