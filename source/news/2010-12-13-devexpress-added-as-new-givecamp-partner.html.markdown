I’m excited to announce that DevExpress has joined the ranks of GiveCamp partners! They’re offering free developer licenses to their amazing products if you participate as a developer in a GiveCamp event. The charity applications you create can also take advantage of the free license, so everybody wins!

DevExpress engineers feature-complete Presentation Components, Reporting Systems, IDE Productivity Tools and Business Application Frameworks for Visual Studio. Whether targeting the WinForms, ASP.NET, WPF or Silverlight platform, developer licenses for our award-winning product line are donated completely free of charge to allow you to create innovative solutions to solve the needs of your chosen charity.

If you want more information about how to take advantage of this generous offer at your local GiveCamp event, please contact Rachel Hawley at <rachelh@devexpress.com>
