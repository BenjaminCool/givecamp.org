GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over two million people use GitHub to build amazing things together. With the collaborative features of GitHub.com, our desktop and mobile apps, and GitHub:Enterprise, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write better code, faster. GitHub loves helping non-profits! We will provide a lifetime Bronze organization plan, free of charge, to any non-profit organization involved in GiveCamps.
