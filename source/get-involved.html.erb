                <h3>For Sponsors</h3>
                <p>
                    As a GiveCamp sponsor, your support helps bring together all of the volunteers and developers that are working 
                    towards creating web applications for the selected non-profit organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the projects created at GiveCamp would typically cost each non-profit between $5,000 and $10,000. 
                    And the efficiencies the solutions create â€“ often reducing the paperwork and staff time needed to complete 
                    work â€“ means GiveCamp creates value beyond the cost of the projects themselves. Sponsors are an important part 
                    of ensuring that non-profits continue to benefit from this valuable work, with no cost to participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will take more than the passion and expertise of our volunteers to make this happen. We need your support to 
                    help provide a fun and rewarding environment for our volunteers and developers.  Your sponsorships help in areas 
                    such as :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meals and snacks for the volunteers and developers throughout the event weekend</li>
                    <li>Software to be used in web site development of the actual web sites</li>
                    <li>Prizes for Giveaways at the end of the event</li>
                    <li>Goodie-bag items for each of the developers and volunteers</li>
                    <li>T-Shirts & Name tags</li>
                    <li>Professional Services</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Sponsors will receive recognition throughout the GiveCamp weekend, including the opportunity to have their 
                    logo printed on materials and featured on the GiveCamp website.
