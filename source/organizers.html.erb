            So, youâ€™re thinking about running a GiveCamp are you?  Congratulations!  Youâ€™re about to enter into a world 
            of fun, excitement and terror unique to organizing charity events in the developer community ðŸ™‚  
            Iâ€™ll post more here when I get the time, but in the interim, be sure to check out some of the resources 
            available to you such as our <%= link_to 'Event Cookbook', '/cookbook.html' %>, and the GiveCamp starter site project on CodePlex.    
        </p>
