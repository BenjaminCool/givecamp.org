Effective as of September 1, 2018.

## General Statement of Privacy
GiveCamp, Inc. respects the privacy of its members and of those who visit the Site (www.givecamp.org). By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy policy.

Subject to the provisions of applicable laws, any information you submit to GiveCamp, Inc. will not be used in any manner to which you have not consented.

## Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") includes, but is not limited to your name and e-mail address. A user's PII is collected through the contact us and/or other forms.

It is GiveCamp, Inc.'s policy not to collect PII about you on the Site without your knowledge or action. You should be aware that if you disclose any information on an open forum that is hosted by GiveCamp, Inc., others may collect that information to send you unsolicited information from outside GiveCamp, Inc., or for other purposes.

Except as otherwise described in this statement, the PII you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of GiveCamp, Inc. without your permission.

## Use of Personally Identifiable Information
It is our general policy not to make PII available to anyone other than our employees, staff, and agents. We will never sell your e-mail address or other PII. The PII you supply us with will be used to provide you with more effective customer service, improve the Site and other GiveCamp, Inc. offerings, and provide you with relevant information. If GiveCamp, Inc. contracts a third party to act on our behalf, such as a website hosting or public relations company, we will only provide them with as much information as needed to provide services and will require they comport with the restrictions of our privacy policy.

GiveCamp, Inc. may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on GiveCamp, Inc. or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of GiveCamp, Inc. or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of GiveCamp, Inc. employees or agents, users of GiveCamp, Inc. products or services, or members of the public.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, information we automatically collect on your use and/or actions on our Site (e.g., user traffic patterns, page views on the Site, click-through rates, search terms that users enter into our search utility). In addition, when a visitor arrives at our site, we collect the IP address, operating system, and browser software used. An IP address (which is not the same as an e-mail address) can tell us the user's internet service provider and, based on that, can suggest the geographic location of the connection. GiveCamp, Inc. recognizes that certain user information of key demographic nature (e.g., race, age, national origin, income), while Non-PII, is still of a sensitive nature to users.

As a general matter, GiveCamp, Inc. does not collect demographic information about you through regular use of the Site. However, in recognition of the sensitive nature of such information, in the event that GiveCamp, Inc. comes into possession of such information, whether through your voluntary submission of such information in response to a special feature on the Site or by receiving such information from any of our business partners, such information shall, when coupled with any of your PII, itself be deemed to be PII and treated by GiveCamp, Inc. as such.

## Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
As a general matter, Non-PII helps us determine how the Site is being used, helps us identify popular areas of the Site, and helps determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities regarding the Site. In the course of collecting, non-PII may be shared with third parties.

## Use of Cookies
The Site uses cookies (i.e., small data files that our Site writes to a user's hard drive) to help track your usage of our site, including what advertising you have seen. The Site's cookies enable us to provide you with services you may request.

You can refuse our cookies by turning them off in your browser (for more information on how to do this, please refer to your browser's documentation). You do not need to have cookies turned on in your browser to use the Site; however, without cookies certain of the automated functions and features of the site may not be available to you. We also use cookies to measure the click-through rate on emails delivered.

## Do Not Track
GiveCamp, Inc. respects user choice and controls. To the extent possible, the Site responds to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals communicated by your browser. However, there is currently no DNT industry standard defined and therefore GiveCamp, Inc. cannot guarantee that it responds to the DNT signal on your browser.

## Third Parties
The Site may contain links to other Internet Web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, including such sites' use of any information.

## Security
You understand and agree that "perfect" security does not exist anywhere, including on the Internet. Information you send to this site, including email messages, may not be encrypted.

## Other Services
You may be able to access certain information related to third parties at the Site, or via links or click-throughs from the Site, regarding the goods or services of third parties. You understand and agree that your access to or use of those services is a matter entirely between you and the associated third parties, and GiveCamp, Inc. shall have no liability whatsoever for any such access or use.

## Notice to Parents or Guardians
We want to help you protect your child's privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet. In particular, GiveCamp, Inc. does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to send any information about yourself to GiveCamp, Inc., including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Site or GiveCamp, Inc.. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us via the "Contact Us" form on the Site. We recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

## Data Retention
You may write us at any time if you wish to have us remove your PII from our database. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
